# Tricks, Part One

Some lessons learned from POSS/PE upgrades...

* PE includes support. Get some help planning it out. There is a new [Puppet Enterprise Upgrade Service](https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fpuppet.app.box.com%2Fs%2Fcrb2vv3z6ssc4dxhe8kwwt3yiba3jyt7) as well.
* PE Classifier - Expect some changes as you move forward. Review the [Preconfigured Node Groups documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/console_classes_groups_preconfigured_groups.html), engage support.
* [`pe_puppetserver_gem`](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/pe_puppetserver_gem) is out, [`puppetserver_gem`](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver_gem) is in.
* Bundled Ruby - If your OS is stuck with Ruby 1.8.7, it is possible to use the PE or AIO Ruby. I recommend rbenv/rvm or SCL-equiv instead, or an OS/version with a newer Ruby.
 * Do not ever do this on your master. EVER!

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
Now that the generalities are out of the way, we can talk specifics...

I know many of us do not like to engage support, but if you do not use it for updates, when will you use it? And if you need someone to do the upgrade, not just assistance, that is an option now as well.

Using the PE/AIO ruby can cause unexpected conflicts between bundled gems and downloaded gems. See PUP-6106 for an example.

# Tricks, Part Two

* Beware string conversion, in puppet DSL and hiera data. Understand how it works.
 * `'undef'` in rspec-puppet represents an undefined value.
 * In Puppet DSL, it is the word undef! You probably want `:undef`, without quotes, instead.
 * If you have a file resource with a title or path of `${undefvar}/${populatedvar}`, rspec will start failing because `file { 'undef/etc/app.conf' :}` is not valid.
 * `'true'` vs `true` and `'false'` vs `false` is another likely candidate.
 * Other issues with input from hiera/ENC, and quoted numbers as strings.
 * May require acceptance tests/canary nodes to become apparent.
 * Keep this in mind if tests pass but agent runs fail or vice versa.

# Tricks, Part Three

* Hiera eyaml gem will be removed during the upgrade to the 4.x puppetserver - more accurately, the new puppetserver environment will not have it present.
 * Enable the yaml backend and ensure that the master itself does not rely on any eyaml-only data. Run the agent on the master to redeploy the gem (with [puppet/hiera](https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/hiera) or similar) before agents check in.
* Hiera scope
 * `%{}` in 3.x and in 4.5 resolves to an empty string. This is often used to prevent variable interpolation, as in `%%{}{environment}` to generate the string `%{environment}`. There was a regression in between those versions and it started returning the scope, giving strings like `%<#Hiera:7329A802#>{environment}`. Use `%{::}` instead, as in `%%{::}{environment}`. May see this during PE upgrades specifically..
 * Additionally, some versions expect `::` prepends to variables and others don't. This may affect your `datadir` value in `hiera.yaml`. Change `%{environment}` to `%{::environment}`.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
Anecdata suggests that sometimes eyaml needs disabled even within the 4.x series, though not in every case.

Be sure the hiera.yaml file gets put in the right location, $confdir or $codedir, depending on your puppet version.

# Tricks, Part Four

* Review modules and their supported versions. Some may be incorrect, or have loose assumptions (`>= 3` but not `< 4` and not tested against v4).
 * When you upgrade across major versions during refactoring, expect additional troubleshooting time and effort.
 * Generally you want to do this early, but if a particular module gives you problems, consider waiting until the master upgrades are done first.
 * If the latest module reports version `999.999.999`, it is probably defunct. Check out the readme for more information!
 * There are quite a few tools to [assist with automating version upgrades in your Puppetfile](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/blob/master/doc/updating-your-puppetfile.mkd#automatic-updates).

* Don't change too much at once if you can help it. The more variables you change at once, the more difficult troubleshooting is. Do not change your fleet's OS distro version at the same time as Puppet upgrades.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
You are going to be making a lot of changes at once, but minimize your coupled or entangled changes. Bumping two modules is ok, bumping distro versions could change just about everything.

# Tools

The tools are constantly improving, so if you have not looked in a while, check it out to see if your concerns were addressed. This is just a sampling of what is out there!

* [puppet-ghostbuster](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-ghostbuster) helps you find "dead code" that you may want to prune before you start on your refactoring journey.
* [puppetlabs_spec_helper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper), [rspec-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet/), and [puppet-lint](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/) are all improving their support for Puppet 4 on a regular basis.
* There are a number of catalog diff tools (including [the diffs](https://forge.puppet.com/modules?utf-8=%E2%9C%93&sort=rank&q=catalog) and [a viewer](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-catalog-diff-viewer)) to inspect the differences between catalogs received from different versions of Puppet.
